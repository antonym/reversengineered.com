XenServer 6.2 is now opensource and it's in sync with the commercial product now. You can get it at <a href="http://xenserver.org" title="xenserver.org" target="_blank">http://xenserver.org</a>. I've updated my installer for 6.2 and you can grab it here: <a href="https://github.com/amesserl/xs-clearwater-openstack" title="xs-clearwater-openstack" target="_blank">https://github.com/amesserl/xs-clearwater-openstack</a>.

As always, you can also boot it from <a href="http://osimag.es" title="osimag.es" target="_blank">osimag.es</a>.
